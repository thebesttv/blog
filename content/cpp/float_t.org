在 [[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Mfe4sAMFUYC&lpg=PT258&ots=tSNQYpM4ti&dq=c%20float_t&pg=PT258#v=onepage&q=c%20float_t&f=false][C in a Nutshell]] 中讲了 =float_t= 与 =double_t= 的作用:
#+begin_quote
The types =float_t= and =double_t=:

The header =math.h= defines the two types =float_t= and =double_t=.
These types represent the floating-point precision used *internally*
by the given implementation in evaluating arithmetic expressions of
the types =float= and =double=.  (If you use operands of the type
=float_t= or =double_t= in your programs, they will not need to be
converted before arithmetic operations, as =float= and =double= may.)
The value of the macro =FLT_EVAL_METHOD=, defined in the header
=float.h=, indicates which basic types correspond to =float_t= and
=double_t=.
