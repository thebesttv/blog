#+title: C++ Primer 笔记

#+begin_quote
Traditional books about programming and programming languages explain
what a language is and how to use it.  However, many people are also
curious about why a language is the way it is and how it came to be
that way.  This book answers these last two questions for C++.  It
explains how C++ evolved from its first design to the language in use
today.  It describes the key problems, design aims, language ideas,
and constraints that shaped C++, and how they changed over time.

Emm... 就重新开始看 C++ Primer. 之前大一的时候大概看到一半就弃坑了,不
造现在能看到哪. 所有笔记基本都是原文复制过来的,还挺多,就先酱8.
