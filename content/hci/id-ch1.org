#+title: Ch1 -- What is Interaction Design?

Interaction Design (ID) means:
#+begin_quote
Designing interactive products to support the way people *communicate*
and *interact* in their everyday and working lives.

Put another way, it's about creating user experiences that *enhance*
and *augment* the way people work, communicate, and interact.

* ID vs HCI

#+begin_quote
We see the main difference between interaction design (ID) and
human-computer interaction (HCI) as one of *scope*.  Historically, HCI
had a narrow focus on the design and usability of *computing systems*,
while ID was seen as being _broader_, concerned with the theory,
research, and practice of designing user experiences for *all manner
of technologies, systems, and products*.  However, nowadays, HCI has
greatly expanded in its scope (Churchill et al., 2013), so much so
that it overlaps much more with ID.
