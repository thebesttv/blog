Cache is *disk data in RAM*.  Linux uses RAM as cache for file data
(from hard-disk).  (Because RAM's IO speed is a thousand times faster
than hard disk, so Operating System will load disk data to RAM as
cache)

Swap is the disk space used for virtual memory purposes.  Linux uses
non-volatile storage device (example: hard-disk, flash-memory) as
virtual memory.  The virtual memory on hard-disk is called swap space.
Virtual memory means the perm storage is used as temp space for RAM.
So, when your RAM is full, the Operating System can off-load parts of
it currently not used data to disk, therefore free up memory for
application that needs it.
