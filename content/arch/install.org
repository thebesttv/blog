#+title: Arch Linux 安装小记

* Using Serial Console

** While Installing

Add =-nographic= to disable graphic when using QEMU.

According to [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/working_with_the_serial_console#Installing_Arch_Linux_using_the_serial_console][Installing Arch Linux using the serial console]] from the
Arch Wiki
- When the boot menu appears, select the first one "Arch Linux install
  medium (x86_64, BIOS)" and press =Tap= to edit kernel parameter.
- Append =console=ttyS0,115200= and press =Enter=.
- Login as =root= and start the installation as usual.

Note that while appending to the kernel parameters, the cursor may look
rather weird, like this
{{{image(100)}}}
[[./install/kernel-parameter.png]]
This is because the kernel parameters are too long to fit in a single
line.  The cursor is now pointing to the right of the last character
(=g=).  Just type a space as separation and input the parameter as
usual.  The cursor will show the characters as you type.

** TODO Normal Boot

* Installation

** Configure Keymap

*** Get Keycode
While in console, use =showkey= to show scancodes[fn:1].
#+begin_src bash
  showkey --scancodes
#+end_src
By default, the command stops automatically when there is no input for
10 seconds.

*** Creating Custom Keymap
Create custom keymap =thebesttv.map= by modifying the =us= keymap,
replacing capslock (keycode 58) with control
#+begin_src bash
  gunzip -c /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us.map.gz | \
      `# use two Alt keys, treat AltGr as Alt` \
      sed 's/linux-with-alt-and-altgr/linux-with-two-alt-keys/' | \
      `# map CapsLock to Control` \
      sed 's/^keycode  58 = Caps_Lock/keycode  58 = Control/' | \
      sudo tee /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/thebesttv.map > /dev/null
#+end_src

*** Persistently Set Keymap
Use =localectl= to set the keymap persistently.  By default, this sets
the keymap for both the console *and X11*, but the =--no-convert= option
*prevents* =localectl= from automatically changing the Xorg keymap to
the nearest match.
#+begin_src bash
  localectl set-keymap --no-convert thebesttv
#+end_src

This, of course, will not be remembered when installing.  After the
installation completes, repeat the whole process in the installed os.
Note that the =localectl set-keymap= command will not work in a chrooted
environment (e.g. =arch-chroot= during installation), so perform the
command on the real machine.
